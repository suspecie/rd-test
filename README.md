## WHY I USE

### ANGULAR / ANGULAR CLI

I currently work with angular, this made me to develop the project faster and could focus on the stages that I had difficulty, being able to study further points of the angular.

- Componentization / Code Reuse
- Easy maintenance
- Community
- [The Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of the box. It already follows our best practices! ](https://cli.angular.io/)

### SCSS

- Easy maintenance

- Class hierarchy


## FOR RED VENTURES

It was a lot of fun creating this application.

I learned many things that I had no domain.
I tried to follow the proposed design as best I could, but I know I still need to learn and focus on a lot of details to improve.

I thought a lot about the user experience, so I changed the menu when the user uses the phone, turning it into a burger menu. Using this menu user can to better experience.

I also learned and apply the service cache so that the user will be able to continue mounting his car even if his internet crashes.
